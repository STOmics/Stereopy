Multi Slices
==============
As clearly stated in the title, this part emphasizes the functions on multiple slices, to delve into biological tissue sample.
Compared to uni-slice, researches on multi-slice analysis aim to interpret relations in a huge dataset, even reconstruct the 3D mesh visualization.
Here we introduce the basic workflow (Clustering on MSData)and critical analysis based on multiple slices.
Likewise, functions performed on one slice could also be used on multi-slice data.
