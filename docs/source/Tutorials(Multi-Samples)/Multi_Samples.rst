Tutorials(Multi Samples)
==============
As clearly stated in the title, this part emphasizes the functions on multiple samples, to delve into biological tissue sample.
Compared to uni-sample, researches on multi-sample analysis aim to interpret relations in a huge dataset, even reconstruct the 3D mesh visualization.
Here we introduce the basic workflow (Clustering on MSData) and critical analysis based on multiple samples.
Likewise, functions performed on one sample could also be used on multi-sample data.
