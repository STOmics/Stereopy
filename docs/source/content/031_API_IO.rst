IO:  `io`
====================

Import Stereopy :

   import stereo as st


The `io` module includes input and output parts. 

The input part supports reading files in multiple formats to generate StereoExpData object, \
such as GEM, GEF, H5ad (from Scanpy and Seurat) and so on. In addition, we provide the conversion \
function between StereoExpData and AnnData so that swithing between tools would be smoother. \
In output part, we support writing StereoExpData as H5ad file for storage.


   The StereoExpData object is designed for efficient parallel computation, \
   which can satisfy the computing needs of multidimensional and massive data \
   especially generated by Stereo-seq with high resolution and large FOV.
