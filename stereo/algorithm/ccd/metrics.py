    Calculate the 2D Shannon entropy of an image.

    Calculate the scatteredness measure of a 2D binary image.

    The scatteredness measure quantifies the degree of scattered or isolated regions in a binary image. It is calculated
    as the ratio of the number of connected components (objects) in the image to the total number of non-zero elements.
    The measure is further corrected based on the size of the neighborhood kernel.

    Parameters:
    - image (numpy.ndarray): The input binary image as a 2D NumPy array.
    - kernel (numpy.ndarray): The neighborhood kernel used for connectivity. It should be a 2D binary array,
                               typically representing 4 or 8 neighbors connectivity.
