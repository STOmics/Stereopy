**Stereopy** is a fundamental and comprehensive tool for mining and visualization based on spatial transcriptomics data, such as Stereo-seq (spatial enhanced resolution omics sequencing) data. More analysis will be added here, either from other popular tools or developed by ourselves, to meet diverse requirements. Meanwhile, we are still working on the improvement of performance and calculation efficiency.
